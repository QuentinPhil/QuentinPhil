- ðŸ‘‹ Hey github! Iâ€™m âœ¨@QuentinPhilâœ¨
- Iâ€™m currently learning about data analysis, math, and programming at William & Mary.
- On my profile you can find projects I've worked on for class as well as a few personal projects to experiment with Python.
- I would love any opportunities to collaborate on projects particularly in the gaming or music space to improve my programming skills.
